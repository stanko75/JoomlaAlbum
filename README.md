Joomla! gallery
---
Joomla article which I want to use as photo album. Code is copy pasted mostly from [this](https://github.com/stanko75/myPhotoAlbum) repository. 
Idea is to use one code for Joomla! articles, and myPhotoAlbum which is planned to be as a separate album with more features.
Example see [here](http://www.milosev.com/2015-01-23-20-08-55/gallery/499-hiking-bonn.html).
